# Secure Cloud Run Example

This example showcases the deployment of Secure Cloud Run, along with domain mapping and IAM policy for the service.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this example will create/trigger are:

* Creates Firewall rules on your **VPC Project**.
  * Serverless to VPC Connector
  * VPC Connector to Serverless
  * VPC Connector to LB
  * VPC Connector Health Checks
* Creates a sub network to VPC Connector usage purpose.
* Creates Serverless Connector on your **VPC Project** or **Serverless Project**. Refer the comparison below:
  * Advantages of creating connectors in the [VPC Project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-shared-vpc#host-project)
  * Advantages of creating connectors in the [Serverless Project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-shared-vpc#service-projects)
* Grant the necessary roles for Cloud Run are able to use VPC Connector on your Shared VPC when creating VPC Connector in host project.
  * Grant Network User role to Cloud Services service account.
  * Grant VPC Access User to Cloud Run Service Identity when deploying VPC Access.
  * Creates KMS Keyring and Key for [customer managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/using-cmek) in the **KMS Project** to be used by Cloud Run.
  * Enables Organization Policies related to Cloud Run in the **Serverless Project**.
  * Allow Ingress only from internal and Cloud Load Balancing.
  * Allow VPC Egress to Private Ranges Only.
  * Creates a Cloud Run Service.
  * Creates a Load Balancer Service using Google-managed SSL certificates.
  * Creates Cloud Armor Service only including the preconfigured rules for SQLi, XSS, LFI, RCE, RFI, Scannerdetection, Protocolattack and Sessionfixation.

## Organization Policies

By default, this example will apply 2 organization policies at the project level for the **Serverless Project**.
  * Allow Ingress only from internal and Cloud Load Balancing.
  * Allow VPC Egress to Private Ranges Only.

To the organization policies to be applied at folder or organization level, the `policy_for` variable needs to be changed. Possible values: [\"project\", \"folder\", \"organization\"] and the variables `folder_id` or `organization_id` need to be be filled up, respectively.

## Usage

To provision this example, run the following from within this directory:

- Rename `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` by running `mv terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars` and update the file with values from your environment.
- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build

### Clean up

- Run `terraform destroy` to clean up your environment.

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

This example assumes that below mentioned pre-requisites are in place before consuming the example.

* All required APIs are enabled in the GCP Project.
* An Organization.
* A Billing Account.
