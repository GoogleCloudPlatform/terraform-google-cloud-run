## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for using this example.

### Software

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) ~> v0.13+

* [Terraform Provider for GCP Beta](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google-beta) ~>
  v3.53+

### Service Account

A service account can be used with required roles to execute this example:

* Cloud Run Admin: `roles/run.admin`

Know more about [Cloud Run Deployment Permissions](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/iam/roles#additional-configuration).

The [Project Factory module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google/latest) and the
[IAM module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/iam/google/latest) may be used in combination to provision a service account with the necessary roles applied.

### APIs

A project with the following APIs enabled must be used to host the main resource of this example:

* Google Cloud Run: `run.googleapis.com`
* Serverless VPC Access:`vpcaccess.googleapis.com`
