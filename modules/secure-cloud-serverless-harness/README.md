# Secure Cloud Run Harness

This module creates the infrastructure required by Secure Cloud Run module.

This module deploys:

* A folder to store Serverless infrastructure.
* The service project where Cloud Run is going to be deployed.
* The security project where KMS and Artifact Registry are going to be created.
  * Keyring and Key created for Artifact Registry.
  * Artifact Registry created with Encryption Key.
  * Hello World example image copied to Artifact Registry.
* A network and one subnetwork.
* Firewall rules:
  * Deny all egress traffic.
  * Allow Restricted and Private Google APIs.
* Configure a Private Service Connect.
* Creates an Access Level and a Service Perimeter with both projects and restricting the services bellow:
  * Cloud KMS.
  * Cloud Run.
  * Artifact Registry.
  * Container Registry.
  * Container Analysis.
  * Binary Authorization.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "secure_cloud_run_harness" {
  source  = "GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run/google//modules/secure-cloud-run-harness"
  version = "~> 0.3.0"
