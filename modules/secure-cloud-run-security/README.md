# Secure Cloud Run Security

This module handles the basic deployment security configurations for Cloud Run usage.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

* Creates KMS Keyring and Key for [customer managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/using-cmek) in the **KMS Project**
to be used by Cloud Run.
* Enables Organization Policies related to Cloud Run in the **Serverless Project**.
  * Allow Ingress only from internal and Cloud Load Balancing.
  * Allow VPC Egress to Private Ranges Only.
* When groups emails are provided, this module will grant the roles for each persona.
  * Serverless administrator - Service Project
    * roles/run.admin
    * roles/compute.networkViewer
    * compute.networkUser
  * Servervless Security Administrator - Security project
    * roles/run.viewer
    * roles/cloudkms.viewer
    * roles/artifactregistry.reader
  * Cloud Run developer - Security project
    * roles/run.developer
    * roles/artifactregistry.writer
    * roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter
  * Cloud Run user - Service project
    * roles/run.invoker

## Usage

```hcl
module "cloud_run_security" {
  source = "../secure-cloud-run-security"

  kms_project_id        = <KMS PROJECT ID>
  location              = <KMS LOCATION>
  serverless_project_id = <SERVERLESS PROJECT ID>
  key_name              = <KEY NAME>
  keyring_name          = <KEYRING NAME>
  key_rotation_period   = <KEY ROTATION PERIOD>
  key_protection_level  = <KEY PROTECTION LEVEL>

  encrypters = [
    "serviceAccount:<SERVERLESS IDENTITY EMAIL>",
    "serviceAccount:<CLOUD RUN SERVICE ACCOUNT>"
  ]

  decrypters = [
    "serviceAccount:<SERVERLESS IDENTITY EMAIL>",
    "serviceAccount:<CLOUD RUN SERVICE ACCOUNT>"
  ]
}
```
