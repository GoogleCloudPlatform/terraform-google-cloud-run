# Secure Cloud Run

This module handles the deployment required for Cloud Run usage. Secure-cloud-run module will call the secure-cloud-run-core, secure-cloud-run-net and secure-cloud-run-net modules.

When using a Shared VPC, you can chose where to create the VPC Connector.

_Note:_ When using a single VPC you should provides VPC and Serverless project id with the same value and the value for `connector_on_host_project` variable must be `false`.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

* secure-cloud-run-network module will apply:
  * Creates Firewall rules on your **VPC Project**.
    * Serverless to VPC Connector
    * VPC Connector to Serverless
    * VPC Connector to LB
    * VPC Connector Health Checks
  * Creates a sub network to VPC Connector usage purpose.
  * Creates Serverless Connector on your **VPC Project** or **Serverless Project**. Refer the comparison below:
    * Advantages of creating connectors in the [VPC Project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-shared-vpc#host-project)
    * Advantages of creating connectors in the [Serverless Project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-shared-vpc#service-projects)
  * Grant the necessary roles for Cloud Run are able to use VPC Connector on your Shared VPC when creating VPC Connector in host project.
    * Grant Network User role to Cloud Services service account.
    * Grant VPC Access User to Cloud Run Service Identity when deploying VPC Access.

* secure-cloud-run-security module will apply:

  * Enables Organization Policies related to Cloud Run in the **Serverless Project**.
  * Allow Ingress only from internal and Cloud Load Balancing.
  * Allow VPC Egress to Private Ranges Only.
  * When groups emails are provided, this module will grant the roles for each persona.
    * Serverless Administrator - **Service Project**
